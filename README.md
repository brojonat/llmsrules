# llmsrules

This is a repo for storing the dotfiles I use for various LLM based agents (Cursor, Goose, etc). Each agent seems to take a slightly different format; each provider has a separate folder here.

The `.cursorrules` is the prototypcal example. The only noteworthy difference about Cursor agents is that they uses `.mdc` files.
